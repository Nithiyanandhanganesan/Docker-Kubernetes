-> localhost:8080 is reference to current machine.
-> to get the container traffic, we have to route the port to current machine.
-> port mapping helps to route the traffic from current machine on particular port to specific port on the
   container.

-> port mapping is only for incoming traffic
-> container can connect to any machine for outgoing traffic through internet.

docker run -p 8080:8080 <imageid>
